Federated and homomorphically encrypted learning method for one-layer neural networks

In this work, we present an Federated Learning (FL) method based on a neural network without hidden layers that incorporates homomorphic encryption (HE). Unlike traditional FL methods that require multiple rounds of training for convergence, our method obtains the collaborative global model in a single training round, yielding an effective and efficient model that simplifies management of the FL training process. In addition, since our method includes HE, it is also robust against model inversion attacks.

This method was published in the following article:
